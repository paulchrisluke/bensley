  Bensley.com

</h1>

<h4 align="center">A creative concept piece intended for bensley.com. Client requested an "infinite" way to explore his 300,000 image asset portfolio, his "world". To demonstrate the concept, we built an MVP using Unity, and deployed it using webGL and our backend API meredith-core, to do image delivery. The globe is built using a random and dynamic assortment of the image library, which change as days are clicked. If brought live, heavy optimizations would need to be done, as well as a re-factor to allow better lighting changes to the entire site, not just the globe.
<br></br>
Built as a portfolio to display large amount of images/videos in an interactive fashion. Bensley.com is a concept site which creates an interactive mosiac using the content from a user's portfolio. Clicking on different menu items cycles the globe and content, showing a new category of content. This project is still in beta, and is not supported across all browsers or platforms.
