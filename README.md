# bensley
3d globe built in unity, rendered on a browser, opensource. intended to replace bensley.com. Backend is managed by our opensource API meredith-core.

# about
Built as a portfolio to display large amount of images/videos in an interactive fashion. Benley.com is a concept site which creates an interactive mosiac using the content from a users portfolio. Clicking on different menu items cycle the globe and content, showing a new category of content. This project is still in beta, and is not supported across all browsers or platforms.

# how-to
Unity project files are still being built and will be deployed to a repo once we finish
Upload your portfolio images to cloudinary.com and tag them with the relevant tags per category (monday, tuesday, etc). We intend to build more flexible tagging functionality at some point.
